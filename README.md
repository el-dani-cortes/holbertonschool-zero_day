## General info

As I mentioned before, this is my first project and of course my first repository. In this repo you will find very basic programming topics, how to work in a virtual machine and which text editors you can use. I recommend you 100% emacs, for me it's the best! You can play tetris with this editor. 

## Technologies

Holberton school asks us to work with a specific version of some programms. That is, because they use a code checker on the intranet that works with these versions: 

 - [Linux](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/) vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64 3.13.0-170-generic #220-Ubuntu SMP. 
 - GNU Emacs 24.3.1.
 - Vi - Version 7.4.52 .
 - Git version 1.9.1.
 - [Github](https://github.com/)
